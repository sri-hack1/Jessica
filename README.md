# Isabella - The LLM Chatbot

Isabella is an AI-powered chatbot using Large Language Models (LLMs) for natural conversation, equipped with speech recognition and text-to-speech functionality. The system is organized into two main modules: Chatbot (text-based interaction) and SpeechRecog (speech handling), all managed from the main Isabella folder.
